# ReactJS App - Challenge

This is a ReactJS App challenge that I developed for [MATERA Systems](http://www.matera.com/br/) in recruitment process.
It's based in [Buscap√©](http://www.buscape.com.br/) product page.

------------------------------

## Overview of Challenge
#### Create a simple product page using ReactJS
- Header with search field, profile area with dropdown and breadcrumb, all of them static;
- Main content with static product information. Create a functional gallery;
- Below the product information, create a section with cards of static products, with a favorite button;
- The favorite button need to be clickable to toggle between favorited and not favorited. When click the button, the user need to receive a feedback about your action;
- Organize the CSS with ITCSS;
- Would be cool with use BEM for nomenclature of CSS (Optional).
